<!--
Thanks for sending a pull request!

In case you are changing only tests for a specific environment and don't need to
run all test environments, add the following line to your PR description on a
separate line! E.g.: [CI:TOXENVS] postgres,minimal

The following tox environments are always added:
build, all, repository, metadata, multistage

You can obtain the list of all available environments by running `tox -l`.
